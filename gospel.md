# The Gospel according to Mark and Matthew both

Matthew 26:1-5
1 When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples,
2 "You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified."
3 Then the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,
4 and they conspired to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him.
5 But they said, "Not during the festival, or there may be a riot among the people."

Mark 14:3-10
3 While *Jesus* was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at the table, a woman came with an alabaster jar of very costly ointment of nard, and she broke open the jar and poured the ointment on his head.
4 But some were there, including the disciples, who said to one another in anger, "Why was the ointment wasted in this way?
5 For this ointment could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii, and the money given to the poor." And they scolded her.
6 But Jesus said, "Let her alone; why do you trouble her? She has performed a good service for me.
7 For you always have the poor with you, and you can show kindness to them whenever you wish; but you will not always have me.
8 She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand for its burial.
9 Truly I tell you, wherever the good news is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will be told in remembrance of her."
10 Then Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went to the chief priests in order to betray him to them.

Matthew 26:15
15 and said, "What will you give me if I betray him to you?"

Mark 14:11
11 When they heard it, they were greatly pleased, and promised to give him money. ...

Magnus
Then he demanded they give him proof. So right then and there,

Matthew 26:15-16
15 ... They paid him thirty pieces of silver.
16 And from that moment he began to look for an opportunity to betray him.

Mark 14:12-21
12 On the first day of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb is sacrificed, his disciples came to Jesus and said to him, "Where do you want us to go and make the preparations for you to eat the Passover?"
13 So he sent two of his disciples, saying to them, "Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him,
14 and wherever he enters, say to the owner of the house, "The Teacher asks, Where is my guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?'
15 He will show you a large room upstairs, furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there."
16 So the disciples set out and went to the city, and found everything as he had told them; and they prepared the Passover meal.
17 When it was evening, he came with the twelve.
18 And when they had taken their places and were eating, Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me, one who is eating with me."
19 They began to be distressed and to say to him one after another, "Surely, not I?"
20 He said to them, "It is one of the twelve, one who is dipping bread into the bowl with me.
21 For the Son of Man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that one by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that one not to have been born."

Matthew 26:26-33
26 While they were eating, Jesus took a loaf of bread, and after blessing it he broke it, gave it to the disciples, and said, "Take, eat; this is my body."
27 Then he took a cup, and after giving thanks he gave it to them *and all of them drank from it*, saying, "Drink from it, all of you;
28 for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
29 I tell you, I will never again drink of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom."
30 When they had sung the hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
31 Then Jesus said to them, "You will all become deserters because of me this night; for it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'
32 But after I am raised up, I will go ahead of you to Galilee."
33 Peter said to him, "Though all become deserters because of you, I will never desert you."

Mark 14:30-39
30 Jesus said to him, "Truly I tell you, this day, this very night, before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times."
31 But he said vehemently, "Even though I must die with you, I will not deny you." And all of them said the same.
32 They went to a place called Gethsemane; and he said to his disciples, "Sit here while I pray."
33 He took with him Peter and James and John, and began to be distressed and agitated.
34 And he said to them, "I am deeply grieved, even to death; remain here, and keep awake."
35 And going a little farther, he threw himself on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.
36 He said, "Abba, Father, for you all things are possible; remove this cup from me; yet, not what I want, but what you want."
37 He came and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter, "Simon, are you asleep? Could you not keep awake one hour?
38 Keep awake and pray that you may not come into the time of trial; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."
39 And again he went away and prayed, saying the same words.

Matthew 26:42
42 *And in the second time he also* prayed, "My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be done."

Mark 14:40
40 And once more he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy; and they did not know what to say to him.

Matthew 26:44
44 So leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same words.

Mark 14:41-45
41 He came a third time and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? Enough! The hour has come; the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
42 Get up, let us be going. See, my betrayer is at hand."
43 Immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived; and with him there was a crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders.
44 Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, "The one I will kiss is the man; arrest him and lead him away under guard."
45 So when he came, he went up to him at once and said, "Rabbi!" and kissed him.

Matthew 26:50-54
50 Jesus said to him, "Friend, do what you are here to do." Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and arrested him.
51 Suddenly, one of those with Jesus put his hand on his sword, drew it, and struck the slave of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
52 Then Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back into its place; for all who take the sword will perish by the sword.
53 Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels?
54 But how then would the scriptures be fulfilled, which say it must happen in this way?"

Mark 14:48-52
48 Then Jesus said to them, "Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as though I were a bandit?
49 Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not arrest me. But let the scriptures be fulfilled."
50 All of *the disciples* deserted him and fled.
51 A certain young man was following him, wearing nothing but a linen cloth. They caught hold of him,
52 but he left the linen cloth and ran off naked.

Matthew 26:57
57 Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas the high priest, in whose house the scribes and the elders had gathered.

Mark 14:54
54 Peter had followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest; and he was sitting with the guards, warming himself at the fire.

Matthew 26:58
... He sat with the guards in order to see how this would end.

Mark 14:55-60
55 Now the chief priests and the whole council were looking for testimony against Jesus to put him to death; but they found none.
56 For many gave false testimony against him, and their testimony did not agree.
57 *At last* some *two* stood up and gave false testimony against him, saying,
58 "We heard him say, "I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another, not made with hands.' "
59 But even on this point their testimony did not agree.
60 Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, "Have you no answer? What is it that they testify against you?"

Matthew 26:63-64
63 But Jesus was silent. Then the high priest said to him, "I put you under oath before the living God, tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God."
64 Jesus said to him, "*I am*. You have said so. But I tell you, From now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven."

Mark 14:61-69
63 Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "*He has blasphemed!* Why do we still need witnesses?
64 You have heard his blasphemy! What is your decision?" All of them condemned him as deserving death.
65 Some began to spit on him, to blindfold him, and to strike him, saying to him, "Prophesy *to us, you Messiah! Who is it that struck you?*" The guards also took him over and beat him.
66 While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant-girls of the high priest came by.
67 When she saw Peter warming himself, she stared at him and said, "You also were with Jesus, the *Galilean* man from Nazareth."
68 But he denied it *before all of them*, saying, "I do not know or understand what you are talking about." And he went out into the forecourt. Then the cock crowed.
69 And the servant-girl, on seeing him, began again to say to the bystanders, "This man is one of them."

Matthew 26:71-73
71 When he went out to the porch, another servant-girl saw him, and she said to the bystanders, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
72 Again he denied it with an oath, "I do not know the man."
73 After a little while the bystanders came up and said to Peter, "Certainly you are also one of them, for your accent betrays you."

Mark 14:70-72
70 ... you are a Galilean."
71 But he began to curse, and he swore an oath, "I do not know this man you are talking about."
72 At that moment the cock crowed for the second time. Then Peter remembered that Jesus had said to him, "Before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times." And he *went out* and broke down and wept.

Matthew 27:1-10
1 When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people conferred together against Jesus in order to bring about his death.
2 They bound him, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate the governor.
3 When Judas, his betrayer, saw that Jesus was condemned, he repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders.
4 He said, "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood." But they said, "What is that to us? See to it yourself."
5 Throwing down the pieces of silver in the temple, he departed; and he went and hanged himself.
6 But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, "It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since they are blood money."
7 After conferring together, they used them to buy the potter's field as a place to bury foreigners.
8 For this reason that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.
9 Then was fulfilled what had been spoken through the prophet Jeremiah, "And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of the one on whom a price had been set, on whom some of the people of Israel had set a price,
10 and they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me."
11 Now Jesus stood before the governor; and the governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus said, "You say so."

Mark 15:3
3 Then the chief priests accused him of many things.

Matthew 27:12
12 But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he did not answer.

Mark 15:4-10
4 Pilate asked him again, "Have you no answer? See how many charges they bring against you."
5 But Jesus made no further reply, so that Pilate was amazed.
6 Now at the festival he used to release a prisoner for them, anyone for whom they asked.
7 Now a *notorious* man called *Jesus* Barabbas was in prison with the rebels who had committed murder during the insurrection.
8 So the crowd came and began to ask Pilate to do for them according to his custom.
9 Then he answered them, "Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?"
10 For he realized that it was out of jealousy that the chief priests had handed him over.

Matthew 27:19
19 While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, "Have nothing to do with that innocent man, for today I have suffered a great deal because of a dream about him."

Mark 15:11-14
11 But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release Barabbas for them instead.
12 Pilate spoke to them again, "Then what do you wish me to do with the man you call the King of the Jews?"
13 They shouted back, "Crucify him!"
14 Pilate asked them, "Why, what evil has he done?" But they shouted all the more, "Crucify him!"

Matthew 27:24-28
24 So when Pilate saw that he could do nothing, but rather that a riot was beginning, he took some water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this man's blood; see to it yourselves."
25 Then the people as a whole answered, "His blood be on us and on our children!"
26 *But wishing to satisfy the crowd,* he released Barabbas for them; and after flogging Jesus, he handed him over to be crucified.
27 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the governor's headquarters, and they gathered the whole cohort around him.
28 They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him,

Mark 15:17
17 And they clothed him in a purple cloak; and after twisting some thorns into a crown, they put it on him.

Matthew 27:29-30
29 ... They put a reed in his right hand and knelt before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
30 They spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.

Mark 15:20-22
20 After mocking him, they stripped him of the purple cloak *and the robe* and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify him.
21 They compelled a passer-by, who was coming in from the country, to carry his cross; it was Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus.
22 Then they brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means the place of a skull).

Matthew 27:34
34 they offered him wine to drink, mixed with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not drink it.

Mark 15:23
23 And they offered him wine mixed with myrrh; but he did not take it.

Mark 15:25
25 It was nine o'clock in the morning when they crucified him.

Matthew 27:35-44
35 And when they had crucified him, they divided his clothes among themselves by casting lots;
36 then they sat down there and kept watch over him.
37  Over his head they put the *inscription of the* charge against him, which read, "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
38 Then two bandits were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
39 Those who passed by derided him, shaking their heads
40 and saying, "*Aha!* You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross."
41 In the same way the chief priests also, along with the scribes and elders, were mocking him, saying,
42 "He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let *the Messiah* come down from the cross now, *so we may see* and we will believe in him.
43 He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he wants to; for he said, 'I am God's Son.'"
44 The bandits who were crucified with him also taunted him in the same way.

Mark 15:33-36
33 When it was noon, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon.
34 At three o'clock Jesus cried out with a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?" which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
35 When some of the bystanders heard it, they said, "Listen, he is calling for Elijah."
36 And someone ran, filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a stick, and gave it to him to drink, saying, "Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down."

Matthew 27:49-56
49 But the others said, "Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him."
50 Then Jesus cried again with a loud voice and breathed his last.
51 At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. The earth shook, and the rocks were split.
52 The tombs also were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised.
53 After his resurrection they came out of the tombs and entered the holy city and appeared to many.
54 Now when the centurion and those with him, who were keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and what took place, they were terrified and said, "Truly this man was God's Son!"
55 Many women were also there, looking on from a distance; they had followed Jesus from Galilee and had provided for him.
56 Among them were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and *Salome who might be* the mother of the sons of Zebedee *(who was also there if not)*.

Mark 15:41-47
41 These *(The two Marys and Salome)* used to follow him and provided for him when he was in Galilee; and there were many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem.
42 When evening had come, and since it was the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,
43 Joseph of Arimathea, a respected member of the council, who was also himself waiting expectantly for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
44 Then Pilate wondered if he were already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he had been dead for some time.
45 When he learned from the centurion that he was dead, he granted the body to Joseph; *he ordered it to be given to him*.
46 Then Joseph bought a linen cloth, and taking down the body, wrapped it in the linen cloth, and laid it in a tomb that had been hewn out of the rock. He then rolled a stone against the door of the tomb *and went away*.
47 Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses *were there, sitting opposite the tomb and* saw where the body was laid.

Matthew 27:62-66
62 The next day, that is, after the day of Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate
63 and said, "Sir, we remember what that impostor said while he was still alive, 'After three days I will rise again.'
64 Therefore command the tomb to be made secure until the third day; otherwise his disciples may go and steal him away, and tell the people, 'He has been raised from the dead,' and the last deception would be worse than the first."
65 Pilate said to them, "You have a guard of soldiers; go, make it as secure as you can."
66 So they went with the guard and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone.

Matthew 28:1-8
1 After the sabbath, as the first day of the week was dawning, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
2 And suddenly there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord, descending from heaven, came and rolled back the stone and sat on it.
3 His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.
4 For fear of him the guards shook and became like dead men.
5 But the angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid; I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified.
6 He is not here; for he has been raised, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay.
7 Then go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has been raised from the dead, and indeed he is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see him.' This is my message for you."
8 So they left the tomb quickly with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples.

Magnus
But, after leaving the tomb, Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James passed Salome, who was bringing spices to anoint him. And Salome did not believe them.
And the Marys wondered if they had really seen an angel. So they went with Salome.

Mark 16:2-8
2 *So* very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went *again* to the tomb.
3 They had been saying to one another, "Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?"
4 When they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had already been rolled back.
5 As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man, dressed in a white robe, sitting on the right side; and they were alarmed.
6 But he said to them, "Do not be alarmed; you are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has been raised; he is not here. Look, there is the place they laid him.
7 But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see him, just as he told you."
8 So they went out and fled from the tomb, for terror and amazement had seized them; and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.

Matthew 28:9-20
9 Suddenly Jesus met them and said, "Greetings!" And they came to him, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
10 Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me."
11 While they were going, some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests everything that had happened.
12 After the priests had assembled with the elders, they devised a plan to give a large sum of money to the soldiers,
13 telling them, "You must say, "His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.'
14 If this comes to the governor's ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble."
15 So they took the money and did as they were directed. And this story is still told among the Jews to this day.
16 Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them.
17 When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted.
18 And Jesus came and said to them, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
19 Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
20 and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age."
