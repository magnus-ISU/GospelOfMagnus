# The Gospel according to Mark and Matthew and Luke also

Matthew 26:1-4
1 When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples,
2 "You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified."
3 Then the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,
4 and they conspired to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him.

Luke 22:2
2 ... For they were afraid of the people.

Matthew 26:5
5 But they said, "Not during the festival, or there may be a riot among the people."

Mark 14:3-9
3 While *Jesus* was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at the table, a woman came with an alabaster jar of very costly ointment of nard, and she broke open the jar and poured the ointment on his head.
4 But some were there, *including the disciples,* who said to one another in anger, "Why was the ointment wasted in this way?
5 For this ointment could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii, and the money given to the poor." And they scolded her.
6 But Jesus said, "Let her alone; why do you trouble her? She has performed a good service for me.
7 For you always have the poor with you, and you can show kindness to them whenever you wish; but you will not always have me.
8 She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand for its burial.
9 Truly I tell you, wherever the good news is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will be told in remembrance of her."

Luke 22:3-4
3 Then Satan entered into Judas called Iscariot, who was one of the twelve;
4 he went away and conferred with the chief priests and officers of the temple police about how he might betray him to them.

Matthew 26:15
15 and said, "What will you give me if I betray him to you?"

Mark 14:11
11 When they heard it, they were greatly pleased, and promised to give him money. ...

Magnus
Then he demanded they give him proof. So right then and there,

Matthew 26:15-16
15 ... They paid him thirty pieces of silver.
16 And from that moment he began to look for an opportunity to betray him.

Mark 14:12
12 On the first day of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb is sacrificed, his disciples came to Jesus and said to him, "Where do you want us to go and make the preparations for you to eat the Passover?"

Luke 22:7-8
7 Then came the day of Unleavened Bread, on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed.
8 So Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and prepare the Passover meal for us that we may eat it."

Mark 14:12
12 ... His disciples came to Jesus and said to him, "Where do you want us to go and make the preparations for you to eat the Passover?"

Luke 22:10-13
10 "Listen," he said to them, "when you have entered the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him into the house he enters
11 and say to the owner of the house, "The teacher asks you, "Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?" '
12 He will show you a large room upstairs, already furnished. Make preparations for us there."
13 So they went and found everything as he had told them; and they prepared the Passover meal.

Mark 14:17-21
17 When it was evening, he came with the twelve.
18 And when they had taken their places and were eating, Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me, one who is eating with me."
19 They began to be distressed and to say to him one after another, "Surely, not I?"
20 He said to them, "It is one of the twelve, one who is dipping bread into the bowl with me.
21 For the Son of Man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that one by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that one not to have been born."

Luke 22:15-19
15 He said to them, "I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer;
16 for I tell you, I will not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God."
17 Then he took a cup, and after giving thanks he said, "Take this and divide it among yourselves;
18 for I tell you that from now on I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes."
19 Then he took a loaf of bread, and *after blessing it and* when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, *"Take, eat;* This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me."

Matthew 26:27-29
27 Then *after supper* he took a cup, and after giving thanks he gave it to them *and all of them drank from it*, saying, "Drink from it, all of you;
28 for this *cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood*, my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
29 I tell you, I will never again drink of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom."

Luke 22:21-39
21 But see, the one who betrays me is with me, and his hand is on the table.
22 For the Son of Man is going as it has been determined, but woe to that one by whom he is betrayed!"
23 Then they began to ask one another which one of them it could be who would do this.
24 A dispute also arose among them as to which one of them was to be regarded as the greatest.
25 But he said to them, "The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those in authority over them are called benefactors.
26 But not so with you; rather the greatest among you must become like the youngest, and the leader like one who serves.
27 For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.
28 "You are those who have stood by me in my trials;
29 and I confer on you, just as my Father has conferred on me, a kingdom,
30 so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
31 "Simon, Simon, listen! Satan has demanded to sift all of you like wheat,
32 but I have prayed for you that your own faith may not fail; and you, when once you have turned back, strengthen your brothers."
33 And he said to him, "Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death!"
34 Jesus said, "I tell you, Peter, the cock will not crow this day, until you have denied three times that you know me."
35 He said to them, "When I sent you out without a purse, bag, or sandals, did you lack anything?" They said, "No, not a thing."
36 He said to them, "But now, the one who has a purse must take it, and likewise a bag. And the one who has no sword must sell his cloak and buy one.
37 For I tell you, this scripture must be fulfilled in me, "And he was counted among the lawless'; and indeed what is written about me is being fulfilled."
38 They said, "Lord, look, here are two swords." He replied, "It is enough."
39 *When they had sung the hymn*, He came out and went, as was his custom, to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples followed him.

Matthew 26:31-33
31 Then Jesus said to them, "You will all become deserters because of me this night; for it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'
32 But after I am raised up, I will go ahead of you to Galilee."
33 Peter said to him, "Though all become deserters because of you, I will never desert you."

Mark 14:30
30 Jesus said to him, "Truly I tell you, this day, this very night, before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times."

Magnus
(Thus he added to his first prophecy, for the cock would crow that night once, then once in the day. But this was done to fulfill the words of the scripture, both Luke 22:34 and Mark 14:30.)

Mark 14:31-32
31 But he said vehemently, "Even though I must die with you, I will not deny you." And all of them said the same.
32 They went to a place called Gethsemane; and he said to his disciples, "Sit here while I pray."

Luke 22:40
40 When he reached the place, he said to them, "Pray that you may not come into the time of trial."

Mark 14:33-39
33 He took with him Peter and James and John, and began to be distressed and agitated.
34 And he said to them, "I am deeply grieved, even to death; remain here, and keep awake."
35 And going a little farther, he threw himself on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.
36 He said, "Abba, Father, for you all things are possible; remove this cup from me; yet, not what I want, but what you want."
37 He came and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter, "Simon, are you asleep? Could you not keep awake one hour?
38 Keep awake and pray that you may not come into the time of trial; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."
39 And again he went away and prayed, saying the same words.

Matthew 26:42
42 *And in the second time he also* prayed, "My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be done."

Mark 14:40
40 And once more he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy; and they did not know what to say to him.

Matthew 26:44
44 So leaving them again, he went away, *knelt down,* and prayed for the third time, saying the same words.

Luke 22:42-46
42 *And also saying* "Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me; yet, not my will but yours be done."
43
44
45 When he got up from prayer, he came to the disciples and found them sleeping because of grief,
46 and he *came a third time and* said to them, "Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray that you may not come into the time of trial."

Mark 14:41-45
41 ... "Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? Enough! The hour has come; the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
42 Get up, let us be going. See, my betrayer is at hand."
43 Immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived; and *he led* a crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders.
44 Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, "The one I will kiss is the man; arrest him and lead him away under guard."
45 So when he came, he went up to him at once and said, "Rabbi!" ...

Luke 22:48
48 but Jesus said to him, "Judas, is it with a kiss that you are betraying the Son of Man?"

Mark 14:45
45 ... and kissed him.

Matthew 26:50
50 Jesus said to him, "Friend, do what you are here to do." Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and arrested him.

Luke 22:49
49 When those who were around him saw what was coming, they asked, "Lord, should we strike with the sword?"

Matthew 26:51-54
51 Suddenly, one of those with Jesus put his hand on his sword, drew it, and struck the slave of the high priest, cutting off his *right* ear.
52 Then Jesus said to him, *"No more of this!* Put your sword back into its place; for all who take the sword will perish by the sword.
53 Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels?
54 But how then would the scriptures be fulfilled, which say it must happen in this way?"

Luke 22:51
51 ... And he touched his ear and healed him.

Mark 14:48-52
48 Then Jesus said to them, "Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as though I were a bandit?
49 Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not arrest me. But let the scriptures be fulfilled. *But this is your hour, and the power of darkness!*"
50 All of *the disciples* deserted him and fled.
51 A certain young man was following him, wearing nothing but a linen cloth. They caught hold of him,
52 but he left the linen cloth and ran off naked.

Matthew 26:57
57 Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas the high priest, in whose house the scribes and the elders had gathered.

Mark 14:54
54 Peter had followed him at a distance, right into the *middle of the* courtyard of the high priest; and he was sitting with the guards, warming himself at the fire.

Matthew 26:58
58 ... He sat with the guards in order to see how this would end.

Mark 14:55-60
55 Now the chief priests and the whole council were looking for testimony against Jesus to put him to death; but they found none.
56 For many gave false testimony against him, and their testimony did not agree.
57 *At last* some *two* stood up and gave false testimony against him, saying,
58 "We heard him say, "I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another, not made with hands.' "
59 But even on this point their testimony did not agree.
60 Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, "Have you no answer? What is it that they testify against you?"

Matthew 26:63-64
63 But Jesus was silent. Then the high priest said to him, "I put you under oath before the living God, tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God."
64 Jesus said to him, "*I am*. You have said so. But I tell you, From now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven."

Mark 14:63-69
63 Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "*He has blasphemed!* Why do we still need witnesses?
64 You have heard his blasphemy! What is your decision?" All of them condemned him as deserving death.
65 Some began to spit on him, to blindfold him, and to strike him, saying to him, "Prophesy *to us, you Messiah! Who is it that struck you?*" The guards also took him over and beat him.
66 *Meanwhile* while Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant-girls of the high priest came by.
67 When she saw Peter warming himself, she stared at him *in the firelight* and said, "You also were with Jesus, the *Galilean* man from Nazareth."
68 But he denied it *before all of them*, saying, *"Woman I do not know him.* I do not know or understand what you are talking about." And he went out into the forecourt. Then the cock crowed.
69 And the servant-girl, on seeing him, began again to say to the bystanders, "This man is one of them."

Matthew 26:71
71 When he went out to the porch, another servant-girl saw him, and she said to the bystanders, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."

Luke 22:58
58 Someone else, on seeing him, said, "You also are one of them." But Peter said, "Man, I am not!"

Matthew 26:72
72 Again he denied it with an oath, "I do not know the man."

Luke 22:59
59 Then *after a little while, even* about an hour later still another kept insisting, "Surely this man also was with him; for he is a Galilean."

Matthew 26:73
73 ... the bystanders came up and said to Peter, "Certainly you are also one of them, for your accent betrays you."

Mark 14:70-71
70 ... you are a Galilean."
71 But he began to curse, and he swore an oath, "I do not know this man you are talking about."

Luke 22:60-61
60 *And* Peter said, "Man, I do not know what you are talking about!" At that moment, while he was still speaking, the cock crowed *for the second time*.
61 The Lord turned and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, "Before the cock crows today, you will deny me three times."

Mark 14:72
72 ... *and* "Before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times." And he *went out* and broke down and wept.

Matthew 27:1
1 When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people conferred together against Jesus in order to bring about his death.

Luke 22:66-71
66 ... and they brought him to their council.
67 They said, "If you are the Messiah, tell us." He replied, "If I tell you, you will not believe;
68 and if I question you, you will not answer.
69 But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God."
70 All of them asked, "Are you, then, the Son of God?" He said to them, "You say that I am."
71 Then they said, "What further testimony do we need? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips!"

Matthew 27:2-10
2 They bound him, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate the governor.
3 When Judas, his betrayer, saw that Jesus was condemned, he repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders.
4 He said, "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood." But they said, "What is that to us? See to it yourself."
5 Throwing down the pieces of silver in the temple, he departed; and he went and hanged himself.
6 But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, "It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since they are blood money."
7 After conferring together, they used them to buy the potter's field as a place to bury foreigners.
8 For this reason that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.
9 Then was fulfilled what had been spoken through the prophet Jeremiah, "And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of the one on whom a price had been set, on whom some of the people of Israel had set a price,
10 and they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me."

Luke 23:2
2 They began to accuse him, saying, "We found this man perverting our nation, forbidding us to pay taxes to the emperor, and saying that he himself is the Messiah, a king."

Matthew 27:11
11 Now Jesus stood before the governor; and the governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus said, "You say so."

Luke 23:4
4 Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, "I find no basis for an accusation against this man.

Mark 15:3
3 Then the chief priests accused him of many things.

Matthew 27:12
12 But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he did not answer.

Mark 15:4-5
4 Pilate asked him again, "Have you no answer? See how many charges they bring against you."
5 But Jesus made no further reply, so that Pilate was amazed.

Luke 23:5-17
5 But they were insistent and said, "He stirs up the people by teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee where he began even to this place."
6 When Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean.
7 And when he learned that he was under Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him off to Herod, who was himself in Jerusalem at that time.
8 When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, for he had been wanting to see him for a long time, because he had heard about him and was hoping to see him perform some sign.
9 He questioned him at some length, but Jesus gave him no answer.
10 The chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing him.
11 Even Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him; then he put an elegant robe on him, and sent him back to Pilate.
12 That same day Herod and Pilate became friends with each other; before this they had been enemies.
13 Pilate then called together the chief priests, the leaders, and the people,
14 and said to them, "You brought me this man as one who was perverting the people; and here I have examined him in your presence and have not found this man guilty of any of your charges against him
15 Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us. Indeed, he has done nothing to deserve death.
16 I will therefore have him flogged and release him."
17

Mark 15:6-8
6 Now at the festival he used to release a prisoner for them, anyone for whom they asked.
7 Now a *notorious* man called *Jesus* Barabbas was in prison with the rebels who had committed murder during the insurrection.
8 So the crowd came and began to ask Pilate to do for them according to his custom.

Luke 23:18
18 Then they all shouted out together, "Away with this fellow! Release Barabbas for us!"

Mark 15:9-10
9 Then he answered them, "Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?"
10 For he realized that it was out of jealousy that the chief priests had handed him over.

Matthew 27:19
19 While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, "Have nothing to do with that innocent man, for today I have suffered a great deal because of a dream about him."

Mark 15:11-13
11 But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release Barabbas for them instead.
12 Pilate, *wanting to release Jesus,* spoke to them again, "Then what do you wish me to do with the man you call the King of the Jews?"
13 They shouted back, "Crucify him!"

Luke 22:21-23
21 ... they kept shouting, "Crucify, crucify him!
22 A third time he said to them, "Why, what evil has he done? I have found in him no ground for the sentence of death; I will therefore have him flogged and then release him."
23 But they kept urgently demanding with loud shouts that he should be crucified; and their voices prevailed.

Matthew 27:24-28
24 So when Pilate saw that he could do nothing, but rather that a riot was beginning, he took some water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this man's blood; see to it yourselves."
25 Then the people as a whole answered, "His blood be on us and on our children!"
26 *And wishing to satisfy the crowd,* he released Barabbas for them; and after flogging Jesus, he handed him over to be crucified.
27 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the governor's headquarters, and they gathered the whole cohort around him.
28 They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him,

Mark 15:17
17 And they clothed him in a purple cloak; and after twisting some thorns into a crown, they put it on him.

Matthew 27:29-30
29 ... They put a reed in his right hand and knelt before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
30 They spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.

Mark 15:20-21
20 After mocking him, they stripped him of the purple cloak *and the robe* and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify him.
21 They *seized and* compelled a passer-by, who was coming in from the country, to carry his cross *behind Jesus*; it was Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus.

Luke 23:27-32
27 A great number of the people followed him, and among them were women who were beating their breasts and wailing for him.
28 But Jesus turned to them and said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.
29 For the days are surely coming when they will say, "Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.'
30 Then they will begin to say to the mountains, "Fall on us'; and to the hills, "Cover us.'
31 For if they do this when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?"
32 Two others also, who were criminals, were led away to be put to death with him.

Mark 15:22
22 Then they brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means the place of a skull).

Matthew 27:34
34 they offered him wine to drink, mixed with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not drink it.

Mark 15:23
23 And they offered him wine mixed with myrrh; but he did not take it.

Mark 15:25
25 It was nine o'clock in the morning when they crucified him.

Luke 23:34
34 [Then Jesus said, "Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing."] ...

Matthew 27:35-43
35 And when they had crucified him, they divided his clothes among themselves by casting lots;
36 then they sat down there and kept watch over him.
37  Over his head they put the *inscription of the* charge against him, which read, "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
38 Then two bandits were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
39 Those who passed by derided him, shaking their heads
40 and saying, "*Aha!* You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross."
41 In the same way the chief priests also, along with the scribes and elders, were mocking him, saying,
42 "He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let *the Messiah* come down from the cross now, *so we may see* and we will believe in him.
43 He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he wants to; for he said, 'I am God's Son.'"

Luke 23:36-37
36 The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine
37 and saying, "If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!"

Matthew 27:34
44 *Both* bandits who were crucified with him also taunted him in the same way.

Luke 23:39-45
39 One of the criminals who were hanged there kept deriding him and saying, "Are you not the Messiah? Save yourself and us!"
40 But the other rebuked him, saying, "Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation?
41 And we indeed have been condemned justly, for we are getting what we deserve for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong."
42 Then he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom."
43 He replied, "Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise."
44 It was now about noon, and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon,
45 while the sun's light failed; ...

Mark 15:34-36
34 At three o'clock Jesus cried out with a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?" which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
35 When some of the bystanders heard it, they said, "Listen, he is calling for Elijah."
36 And someone ran, filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a stick, and gave it to him to drink, saying, "Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down."

Matthew 27:49
49 But the others said, "Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him."

Luke 23:45
45 ... and the curtain of the temple was torn in two.

Magnus
For the Father had heard Jesus' cry. And the Holy of Holies left the temple to join all humanity, and his most Beloved Son.
There was a great wind that left the temple, rushing out to Jesus who stood clothed in a radiant light.
But so great was the glory of God that the curtain of the temple billowed out towards Jesus and fused together again at the passage of the Spirit of God.
But these things were never recorded by the apostles, or the soldiers, or the chief priests and elders, for the disciples fell down on their faces before the LORD and received concussions;
The soldiers were filled with terror and shut their eyes; the chief priests nearly believed, but the LORD hardened their hearts that the scriptures might be fulfilled; and the lowly scribes thought to themselves
"Zounds!" (this means "God's wounds", for they thought the temple curtain *was* God)
And they lacked faith, all the scribes, and did not believe the great signs they had seen, but thought that (as it was afterwards) that the inner sanctum of God had always been empty.
So they only thought about how much money it would cost to quickly replace the huge curtain, so that no record of its having ever been torn would enter into the writings of Men.
And later, after the resurrection, the disciples had forgotten (for they all were slightly brain damaged from falling on their faces) whether the curtain had split before or after Jesus' final words;
And Jesus rebuked them greatly for it, when they began to debate this point. So they shrunk from him and determined not to bother getting the whole story when recounting the Gospels.
But this was all done to fulfill the scriptures, both that Jesus died before the temple curtain split in Luke, and that he died after the temple curtain split in Matthew and Mark, but that no further details were forthcoming on this point.

Luke 23:46
46 Then Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, "Father, into your hands I commend my spirit." Having said this, he breathed his last.

Matthew 27:50-54
50 *So* Jesus cried *these words* with a loud voice and breathed his last.
51 At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. The earth shook, and the rocks were split.
52 The tombs also were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised.
53 After his resurrection they came out of the tombs and entered the holy city and appeared to many.
54 Now when the centurion and those with him, who were keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and what took place, they were terrified and said, "Truly this man was God's Son!"

Luke 23:47-49
47 *The centurion* praised God and said, "Certainly this man was innocent."
48 And when all the crowds who had gathered there for this spectacle saw what had taken place, they returned home, beating their breasts.
49 But all his acquaintances, including the *many* women who had followed him from Galilee *and provided for him*, stood *looking on him* at a distance, watching these things.

Matthew 27:56
56 Among them were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and *Salome who might be* the mother of the sons of Zebedee *(who was also there if not)*.

Mark 15:41-46
41 These *(The two Marys and Salome)* used to follow him and provided for him when he was in Galilee; and there were many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem.
42 When evening had come, and since it was the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,
43 Joseph of Arimathea, a respected member of the council, who was also himself waiting expectantly for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
44 Then Pilate wondered if he were already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he had been dead for some time.
45 When he learned from the centurion that he was dead, he granted the body to Joseph; *he ordered it to be given to him*.
46 Then Joseph bought a linen cloth, and taking down the body, wrapped it in the linen cloth, and laid it in a tomb that had been hewn out of the rock *where no one had ever been laid*. He then rolled a stone against the door of the tomb *and went away*.

Luke 23:54-55
54 It was the day of Preparation, and the sabbath was beginning.
55 The women who had come with him from Galilee followed, and they saw the tomb and how his body was laid.

Mark 15:47
47 Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses *were there, sitting opposite the tomb and* saw where the body was laid.

Luke 23:56
56 Then they returned, and prepared spices and ointments. On the sabbath they rested according to the commandment.

Matthew 27:62-66
62 The next day, that is, after the day of Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate
63 and said, "Sir, we remember what that impostor said while he was still alive, 'After three days I will rise again.'
64 Therefore command the tomb to be made secure until the third day; otherwise his disciples may go and steal him away, and tell the people, 'He has been raised from the dead,' and the last deception would be worse than the first."
65 Pilate said to them, "You have a guard of soldiers; go, make it as secure as you can."
66 So they went with the guard and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone.

Matthew 28:1-8
1 After the sabbath, as the first day of the week was dawning, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
2 And suddenly there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord, descending from heaven, came and rolled back the stone and sat on it.
3 His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.
4 For fear of him the guards shook and became like dead men.
5 But the angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid; I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified.
6 He is not here; for he has been raised, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay.
7 Then go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has been raised from the dead, and indeed he is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see him.' This is my message for you."
8 So they left the tomb quickly with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples.

But, after leaving the tomb, Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James passed Salome, who was bringing spices to anoint him. And Salome did not believe them.
And the Marys wondered if they had really seen an angel. So they went with Salome.

Mark 16:2-8
2 *So* very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went *again* to the tomb.
3 They had been saying to one another, "Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?"
4 When they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had already been rolled back.
5 As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man, dressed in a white robe, sitting on the right side; and they were alarmed.
6 But he said to them, "Do not be alarmed; you are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has been raised; he is not here. Look, there is the place they laid him.
7 But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see him, just as he told you."
8 So they went out and fled from the tomb, for terror and amazement had seized them; and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.

Matthew 28:9-10
9 Suddenly Jesus met them and said, "Greetings!" And they came to him, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
10 Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me."

Luke 24:1
1 But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, *the women who had come with him from Galilee* came to the tomb, taking the spices that they had prepared.

Magnus
These were Joanna and some other women with them, but not Mary Magdalene or Mary the mother of James, nor Salome.
For those had already held the feet of the risen Christ, and believed.

Luke 24:2-10
2 They found the stone rolled away from the tomb,
3 but when they went in, they did not find the body.
4 While they were perplexed about this, suddenly two men in dazzling clothes stood beside them.
5 The women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, "Why do you look for the living among the dead? He is not here, but has risen.
6 Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee,
7 that the Son of Man must be handed over to sinners, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again."
8 Then they remembered his words,
9 and returning from the tomb, they told all this to the eleven and to all the rest.
10 Now it was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them who told this to the apostles.

Magnus
For all the women had met on the road back from the tomb, and in their amazement told each other their stories.

Luke 24:11-51
11 But these words seemed to *the apostles* an idle tale, and they did not believe them.
12 But Peter got up and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; then he went home, amazed at what had happened.
13 Now on that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem,
14 and talking with each other about all these things that had happened.
15 While they were talking and discussing, Jesus himself came near and went with them,
16 but their eyes were kept from recognizing him.
17 And he said to them, "What are you discussing with each other while you walk along?" They stood still, looking sad.
18 Then one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answered him, "Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who does not know the things that have taken place there in these days?"
19 He asked them, "What things?" They replied, "The things about Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,
20 and how our chief priests and leaders handed him over to be condemned to death and crucified him.
21 But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things took place.
22 Moreover, some women of our group astounded us. They were at the tomb early this morning,
23 and when they did not find his body there, they came back and told us that they had indeed seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive.
24 Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said; but they did not see him."
25 Then he said to them, "Oh, how foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have declared!
26 Was it not necessary that the Messiah should suffer these things and then enter into his glory?"
27 Then beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to them the things about himself in all the scriptures.
28 As they came near the village to which they were going, he walked ahead as if he were going on.
29 But they urged him strongly, saying, "Stay with us, because it is almost evening and the day is now nearly over." So he went in to stay with them.
30 When he was at the table with them, he took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them.
31 Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized him; and he vanished from their sight.
32 They said to each other, "Were not our hearts burning within us while he was talking to us on the road, while he was opening the scriptures to us?"
33 That same hour they got up and returned to Jerusalem; and they found the eleven and their companions gathered together.
34 They were saying, "The Lord has risen indeed, and he has appeared to Simon!"
35 Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he had been made known to them in the breaking of the bread.
36 While they were talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, "Peace be with you."
37 They were startled and terrified, and thought that they were seeing a ghost.
38 He said to them, "Why are you frightened, and why do doubts arise in your hearts?
39 Look at my hands and my feet; see that it is I myself. Touch me and see; for a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have."
40 And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.
41 While in their joy they were disbelieving and still wondering, he said to them, "Have you anything here to eat?"
42 They gave him a piece of broiled fish,
43 and he took it and ate in their presence.
44 Then he said to them, "These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you — that everything written about me in the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms must be fulfilled."
45 Then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures,
46 and he said to them, "Thus it is written, that the Messiah is to suffer and to rise from the dead on the third day,
47 and that repentance and forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.
48 You are witnesses of these things.
49 And see, I am sending upon you what my Father promised; so stay here in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high."
50 Then he led them out as far as Bethany, and, lifting up his hands, he blessed them.

But now Mary Magdalene was confused, as Jesus outside the tomb had ordered her, "Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me."
So she entreated the apostles to go to Galilee to see Jesus. At first, they rather wanted to listen to Jesus, who had told them, "stay here in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high."
But Mary convinced them that she had heard Jesus tell them he was going ahead of them. And Matthew remembered that Jesus had said "stay here in the city", but in Bethany, they were outside the city.
So he perceived this was a test to see if the disciples would truly listen to what Jesus was saying, fulfilling all his teachings.
And therefore, he told all the apostles they should go now to Galilee before Jerusalem. But the others were not sure if this was really what Jesus meant.
So they bought 11 swift horses and rode hard the sixty miles from Jerusalem to Galilee, that they might soon return to Jerusalem.

Matthew 28:11-17
11 While they were going, some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests everything that had happened.
12 After the priests had assembled with the elders, they devised a plan to give a large sum of money to the soldiers,
13 telling them, "You must say, "His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.'
14 If this comes to the governor's ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble."
15 So they took the money and did as they were directed. And this story is still told among the Jews to this day.
16 Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them.
17 When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted.

Magnus
Saying, "How can you be Jesus, who we saw just yesterday in Bethany? We rode fast on swift horses! Or how can you be he, who commanded us to stay there but also told Mary to tell us to come here? Why do you confuse us!"
For they had forgotten the meaning of the scriptures which he opened to them just yesterday.

Matthew 28:18-20
18 And Jesus came and said to them, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
19 Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
20 and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age."

Magnus
But Jesus said, "But friends, though the scriptures say "that repentance and forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed in his name to all nations", the forgiveness is "beginning from Jerusalem".
So Jesus told them, "So don't yet go therefore and make disciples of all nations, but return to Jerusalem and stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high."

Luke 24:52-53
52 And they worshiped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy;
53 and they were continually in the temple blessing God.

Acts 1:3-5
3 After his suffering he presented himself alive to them by many convincing proofs, appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God.
4 While staying with them, he ordered them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait there for the promise of the Father. "This," he said, "is what you have heard from me;
5 for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now."
